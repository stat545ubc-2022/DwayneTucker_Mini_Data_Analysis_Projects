# How to Run Repository Files
If working on a local branch:

1: Initiate your local git repository with
  ```
  $git init
```

2: Clone this repository into your local using
```
  $git clone https://github.com/stat545ubc-2022/DwayneTucker_Mini_Data_Analysis_Projects.git
  ```

3: Using your favorite IDE, you can now run the given file from the terminal. For instance, if there was a python file that contained a function to print "Hello world" named helloworld.py, you could run it with:
  ```
  $python helloworld.py
  >>>Hello world!
  ```
